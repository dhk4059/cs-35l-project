# CS 35L Final Project - RateMyResidential
Winter 2022 Web application project for rating and viewing housing ratings around UCLA for CS 35L in UCLA.
The frontend was built with React with Firebase as the backend.

## Instructions on installing and running the app:

Make sure node.js is installed, and if not, install it here:
https://nodejs.org/en/

Once Node.js is installed, run the following commands in terminal in order:
1) git clone https://github.com/dkwack4059/cs-35l-project.git
2) cd cs-35l-project
3) npm install
4) npm start

This series of commands will clone the github repository to your local machine
and install the necessary node modules to run a localhost of the web app.
